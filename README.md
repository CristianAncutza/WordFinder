# WordFinder

Objective: The objective of this challenge is not necessarily just to solve the problem but to
evaluate your software development skills, code quality, analysis, creativity, and resourcefulness
as a potential future colleague. Please share the necessary artifacts you would provide to your
colleagues in a real -world professional setting to best evaluate your work.
Presented with a character matrix and a large stream of words, your task is to create a Class
that searches the matrix to look for the words from the word stream. Words may appear
horizontally, from left to right, or vertically, from top to bottom. In the example below, the word
stream has four words and the matrix contains only three of those words ("chill", "cold" and
"wind"):
The search code must be implemented as a class with the following interface:
public class WordFinder
{
public WordFinder(IEnumerable<string> matrix) {
...
}
public IEnumerable<string> Find(IEnumerable<string> wordstream)
{ ...
}
}
The WordFinder constructor receives a set of strings which represents a character matrix. The
matrix size does not exceed 64x64, all strings contain the same number of characters. The
"Find" method should return the top 10 most repeated words from the word stream found in the
matrix. If no words are found, the "Find" method should return an empty set of strings. If any
word in the word stream is found more than once within the stream, the search results
should count it only once
Due to the size of the word stream, the code should be implemented in a high performance
fashion both in terms of efficient algorithm and utilization of system resources. Where possible,
please include your analysis and evaluation.
